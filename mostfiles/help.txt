INSTALLATION ON LINUX

Download latest linux-release (tar.gz).

Just unpack, place it somewhere in your user-folder.
I prefer to start the app from a terminal, so that the programs status-info can be viewed.
So to run the executable "flashread" firstly open a terminal, then go to the readibl-folder and enter:
./flashread

To access the web-server you just started, click on or type in your browser: http://localhost:5050/flashread-form

If the app is started from a folder where the application does NOT reside (like so: path/to/readibl/flashread), path-problems will occur. This may apply when you want to start the app together with the OS-startup. In that case you need to adjust and start up from flashread_sh (like so: path/to/readibl/flashread_sh)
But if you use flashread_sh, then update it with the path of you readibl-dir.

For the changes see mostfiles/what-is-new.txt

The portnumber can be changed in the configuration-file: settings_flashread.conf

INSTALLATION ON WINDOWS

    -download latest windows-release (.zip)
    -unpack, place it somewhere in your user-folder, and run the executable "flashread.exe".
    -to access the local web-server you just started, type: http://localhost:5050/flashread-form

Usage
Then you get the user-interface in the browser. From there on you can use the clipboard-contents to either reformat a copied text, or use a copied web-address to process and reformat. Experiment with the switches. In the config-file "settings_flashread.conf" you can do the following:

    -the port-number can be adjusted
    -interface-language can be set (besides english there is only dutch for now, but you can make you own language-file *translations.tra).
    -possible processing text-languages; only english.dat en dutch.dat exist for now, but you can make your own.
