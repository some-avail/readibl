    -to access the local web-server you just started, type: http://localhost:5050/flashread-form
    -the portnumber can be changed in the configuration-file: settings_flashread.conf

Then you get the user-interface in the browser. From there on you can use the clipboard-contents to either reformat a copied text, or use a copied web-address to process and reformat. Experiment with the switches. In the config-file "settings_flashread.conf" you can do the following:

    -the port-number can be adjusted
    -interface-language can be set (besides english there is only dutch for now, but you can make you own language-file *translations.tra).
    -possible processing text-languages; only english.dat en dutch.dat exist for now, but you can make your own.
