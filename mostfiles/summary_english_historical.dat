Extraction-strings for summarizing with Flashread.
Language: english
Summary-type: historical
version: unknown


?archetypal scenarios for history:
there is a certain distribution of races and cultures in an area
the area has a more homogenous or more heterogenous population
diff. races / cultures have diff. levels of mental, emotional and moral development
the races and cultures form groups 
groups arise
groups are internally either more equal-powered or more top-powered
groups can split or merge and form alliances
multiple overlapping groups can exist


Lower-moral and top-powered cultures would give following historical interactions:
group increases in power by dominational methods
group grabs or reaches the top-power of an area
group establishes a regime
group conquers a new area
group changes the regime of conquered area
group looses power
group looses areas
group exits off power
a new group takes over and the cycle restarts


To generalize one can substitute area with domain to denote 
other fields like markets or other conquerables fields.


conquerable fields like ground/territory, markets, economic assets, political groups (thru infiltration)
non-conquerable fields like art, nature, positive emotions, harmonic cultures and relations
(these are not conquerable but certainly destructable)
which part of history do you want to focus on? main categories political = conquerable vs. non-political

promotional change-dynamics (for better or for worse):
groups prescribe and propagandize certain behaviors or mechanisms
the government and most culture is (temporarily) changed by adopted behaviors and mechanisms

miscellaneous:
a group changes its own regime / government
